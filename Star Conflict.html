  <p>Description</p>
  <p>Star Conflict is a team-based space battle arena in a nutshell. Imagine this - dodging slower moving shots from destroyers and frigates while trying to evade the fast interceptor ship on your tail, and while targeting the guy who's coming right at you, his hull barely intact. One well placed shot, and you've won the match - if you don't get hit by the crossfire and the now two interceptors targeting you. This is Star Conflict. High adrenaline space combat with tactics and team play similar to other popular MOBA games, such as Dota 2, League of Legends, Overwatch, Smite, and Heroes of the Storm.</p>

<p>Star Conflict goes beyond MOBA gameplay, offering other challenges when you want to take a break from pvp. You can team up with friends to fight through missions together in PVE, or practice your PVP skills and teamplay in co-op vs. ai mode. You can create your own and fight other corporations to take over sectors in Open Space, the sector based space sandbox, where you can explore, do contracts, and team up with others to take out the pirates and alien menace while gathering resources for more advanced ships.</p>
