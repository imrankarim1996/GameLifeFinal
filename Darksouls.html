<p>Description</p>
<p>Dark Souls III  is an action role-playing video game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. The fourth installment of the Souls series and the final installment of the Dark Souls trilogy, the game was released in Japan in March 2016 and worldwide a month later. Two downloadable content (DLC) expansions, Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City, were also made for the game.

Dark Souls III was critically and commercially successful, with critics calling it a worthy and fitting conclusion to the series. It was the fastest-selling game in Bandai Namco's history, shipping over three million copies within its first two months and over 10 million by 2020. A complete version containing the base game and both expansions, Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades, was released in April 2017</p>
