  <p>Description</p>
  <p>League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in the three-dimensional isometric perspective. The game consists of two current running game modes: Summoner's Rift and Howling Abyss. The Crystal Scar and Twisted Treeline, maps corresponding to discontinued game modes, have since been removed.Camera perspective cannot be changed by a player, other than zooming and panning, thus whether the player spawns at the top or bottom bases will be fixed for the duration of the game. Players compete in matches, lasting anywhere from 20 to 50 minutes on average. In each game mode, teams work together to achieve a victory condition, typically destroying the core building (called the Nexus) in the enemy team's base after bypassing a line of defensive structures called turrets, or towers. </p>
  <p>In all game modes, players control characters called champions who each have a set of unique abilities. Players chose or are assigned champions before the start of every match. Champions begin every match at a low level, and then can gain experience over the course of the match to increase their level, with the maximum being 18. Gaining champion levels in matches allows players to unlock their champion's special abilities and augment them in a number of ways unique to each character. If a champion loses all their health, they are defeated but are automatically revived in their base after enough time passes. Players also begin each match with a low amount of gold, and in addition to being given gold by the game over time by default, players earn gold throughout the match in a variety of ways: by killing non-player characters known as minions and monsters; by killing or helping to kill enemy players; by destroying enemy structures and through unique item interactions or champion abilities. This gold is spent throughout the match to buy in-game items that further augment each champion's abilities and gameplay, such as increasing stats like health, ability power, spells. Champion experience, gold earned, and items bought are specific to each match and do not carry over to subsequent matches. Thus, all players begin each match on a more-or-less equal footing relative to their opposing team.</p>
