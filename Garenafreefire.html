<p>Description</p>
<p>Garena Free Fire (also known as Free Fire Battlegrounds or Free Fire) is a battle royale game, developed by 111 Dots Studio  and published by Garena for Android and iOS. It became the most downloaded mobile game globally in 2019,  due to its popularity, the game received the award for the "Best Popular Vote Game" by the Google Play Store in 2019. As of May 2020, Free Fire sets record with over 80 million daily active users globally. As of November 2019, Free Fire has grossed over $1 billion worldwide.</p>

<p>  Garena Free Fire is an online-only action-adventure battle royale game played in a third person perspective.

The game consists of up to 50 players falling from a parachute on an island in search of weapons and equipment to kill the other players. Players are free to choose their starting position, take weapons and supplies to extend the battle life.

When the players join a game, they will enter a plane, which will fly over the play island. While the plane is flying over the island, the players can jump where they want, thus allowing them to choose a strategic place to land away from enemies. After landing, the players must then go looking for weapons and utility items. Medical equipment, medium and large weapons, grenades, and other items featured can be found throughout the island. The ultimate goal of the players is to survive on an island with a maximum of 50-51 players online; this requires eliminating all opponents the players encounter along the way and ensuring that they are the only survivor remaining. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing the surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.</p>
