<p>Description</p>
<p>Brawl Stars is a multiplayer online battle arena  game where players battle against other players or AI opponents in multiple game modes. Players can choose between several brawlers that they have unlocked through "Brawl Boxes" (the game's version of a loot box), the Brawl Pass, the Trophy Road, or purchased through the shop.  As brawlers attack and do damage to enemy brawlers, they build up their special ability, called a "Super". Each brawler has their own "Super" ability, which can, for example, spawn a damage-dealing turret or a complete heal. Each brawler also has two unlockable (passive) abilities called "Star Powers", which can be found in Brawl Boxes, or inside the shop once the brawler reaches their maximum power level.  Furthermore each brawler also has one unlockable ability called a "Gadget". A brawler's gadget appear in Brawl Boxes and in the shop once that brawler reaches power level 7.  These abilities are, once unlocked, usable 2 to 3 times per match and are activated by pressing a certain "Gadget button".  In addition, it is possible to purchase "skins" with gems or unlock them through the Brawl Pass, which will alter the appearance, animations, or sounds of brawlers. Brawl Stars has a variety of different game modes that players can choose from, each one having a different objective. Players can invite friends to play with them up to the maximum team size of the game mode.
