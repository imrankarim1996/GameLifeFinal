  <p>Team Fortress 2 is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed and published by Valve.

It was released in October 2007 as part of The Orange Box video game bundle for Microsoft Windows and the Xbox 360.[1] A PlayStation 3 version followed in December 2007 when The Orange Box was ported to the system.[2] Later in development, the game was released as a standalone title for Windows in April 2008, and was updated to support Mac OS X in June 2010 and Linux in February 2013. It is distributed online through Valve's digital retailer Steam, with Electronic Arts handling all physical and console ports of the game. </p>
