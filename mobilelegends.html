    <p>Description</p>

    <p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (Chinese: 无尽对决; pinyin: wújìn duìjié) is a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) developed and published by Moonton. Released in 2016, the game has become popular in Southeast Asia and was among the games chosen for the first medal event esports competition at the 2019 Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines.

    In July 2018, Tencent on behalf of Riot Games won a lawsuit in Shanghai against Moonton CEO Watson Xu Zhenhua for Mobile Legends' plagiarism of League of Legends, and was awarded a settlement of $2.9 million.</p>

    <p>  Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game designed for mobile phones. The two opposing teams fight to reach and destroy the enemy's base while defending their own base for control of a path, the three "lanes" known as "top", "middle" and "bottom", which connects the bases. Weaker computer-controlled characters, called "minions", spawn at team bases and follow the three lanes to the opposite team's base, fighting enemies and turrets.

    In each team, there are five players who each control a character, known as a "hero" using analog/joystick controls. Heroes can be grouped into 6 different roles, Marksman, Assassin, Mage, Support, Fighter and Tank.</p>
